# PTB (Paymenter ToolBox)

Paymenter ToolBox (PTB) is a command-line tool designed to simplify managing themes in Paymenter. It allows you to easily export, import, rename, and list Paymenter themes packaged as `.paytheme` files.

## Features

- Export a Paymenter theme directory to a compressed `.paytheme` archive.
- Import a `.paytheme` archive into the Paymenter themes directory.
- Rename themes inside `.paytheme` archives, updating references automatically.
- List contents of `.paytheme` archives for quick inspection.

## Installation

You can install PTB by running the installer script directly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QKing-Official/PTB/refs/heads/main/installer | bash
This will download and install the ptb CLI tool for use on your system.
```
## Usage
ptb export -t <theme_path>                # Export theme directory to .paytheme file

ptb import -t <theme_file>                # Import .paytheme file into themes directory

ptb rename -t <theme_file> -n <new_name> # Rename theme inside .paytheme archive

ptb list -t <theme_file>                  # List contents of .paytheme archive

ptb --help                               # Show help

ptb --version                            # Show version

Default theme directory is /var/www/paymenter/themes, but you can specify a different target directory when importing. It's on the start of the ptb file (if you used the installer its at /usr/local/bin/ptb)

## Dependencies
