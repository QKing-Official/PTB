# PTB (Paymenter ToolBox)

Paymenter ToolBox (PTB) is a command-line tool designed to simplify managing themes in Paymenter. It allows you to easily export, import, rename, and list Paymenter themes packaged as `.paytheme` files.

## Features

- Export a Paymenter theme directory to a compressed `.paytheme` archive.
- Import a `.paytheme` archive into the Paymenter themes directory.
- Rename themes inside `.paytheme` archives, updating references automatically.
- List contents of `.paytheme` archives for quick inspection.

## Installation

You can install PTB by running the installer script directly (or by running the ptb file directly):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QKing-Official/PTB/refs/heads/main/installer | bash
```
This will download and install the ptb CLI tool for use on your system.

## Usage
```ptb export -t <theme_path/theme_name>```              # Export theme directory to .paytheme file

```ptb import -t <theme_file>```                # Import .paytheme file into themes directory

```ptb update -t <old_theme_name> <theme_file_new>```                # Import .paytheme file into themes directory

```ptb rename -t <theme_file> -n <new_name>``` # Rename theme inside .paytheme archive

```ptb list -t <theme_file>```                  # List contents of .paytheme archive

```ptb extract -t <theme_file> <output_dir>```        # Extract .paytheme archive to target directory

```ptb validate -t <theme_file>```                    # Validate structure of .paytheme archive

```ptb diff -t <theme1> <theme2>```                   # Compare two themes or directories

```ptb info -t <theme_name>```                        # Show info about installed theme directory

```ptb --help```                               # Show help

```ptb --version```                            # Show version

Default theme directory is /var/www/paymenter/themes, but you can specify a different target directory when importing. It's on the start of the ptb file (if you used the installer its at ```/usr/local/bin/ptb```)

## Dependencies
